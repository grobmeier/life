# Companies with/without giving you invoices

There are quite a couple of companies which charge your for their services,
but then don't give you a proper invoice. Instead, they thing a payment history
is enough. But it's not: at least EU based customers need proper invoices
for their tax offices.

## List of companies which are not giving you invoices

If you need a invoice, you might have problems with consuming these service providers:

 - [BigCartel](http://www.bigcartel.com) - only Receipt/Payment history. They might give you a template,
  which lets your create your own. Still, invoice number is missing.
 - [Skype.com](http://www.skype.com) (in EU, you can only generate Invoices by using 
   a link which is not visible in the website. Without this link, you can't have an invoice. It's:

 - [Rdio.com](http://www.rdio.com) - only Receipt/Payment history.
 - [Scoutapp.com](http://www.scoutapp.com) - only Receipt/Payment history
